Readme for Lab9: Finalizing your portfolio


What is this purpose of this Git repository? 

This github repository is meant to demonstrate the skills learned and products created during my Comp20 Web
Development class, during the fall of 2014. 


What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My personal favorite assignment during this semester was the security report assignment, in which we took on
the role of a security consultant and looked at potential vulnerabilities in a peer's previous assignment.
I learned so much about web security and what it actually means to "hack" something. I found it very relevant
to any real world web development application, as anything I created before this would have huge vulnerability 
issues. 

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I've grown mainly in three areas since my enrolling in this class. Firstly, I've learned about the synchronous vs 
asynchronous protocol and order of hypertext transfers that make up the web. Secondly, I've learned how to utilize a
few packages and modules to build powerful web apps. Thes include bootstrap, mongoDB, express, and jquery. Lastly, I
learned hownto learn on my own, using whatever resources I can find. This includes effectively googling questions to 
ask on stackoverflow and also taking the initiative to ask questions on our piazza board.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

The most important thing I learned in this course is that one cna never trust input from a user. We saw in 
assignment 2 and 3 that it was very easy to input incorrect data while trying to send our location and login info.
Not only this, but we were able to abuse that in assignment 4 to hack into the assignment 3 of another student.
Also I learned that one can prevent this abuse and is not helpless to such attacks, through various methods
of sanitizing inputs.



Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I would like to learn more about networking and web security! I think hacking is really interesting and I
would like to learn more about it. I hopefully will have time to take security taught by Ming Chow at Tufts,
and if not will be able to find an online resource and mentor to help me learn more.
