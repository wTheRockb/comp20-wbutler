<h1> Security Analysis of Thomas Addison's Application </h1>
<h3> By Woody Butler 12/4/2014</h3>	

<h4>Intro<h4>

<p>The purpose of the assignment was to test the security of Tom Addison's heroku webapp. 
The webapp was used to communicate with a mongoDB database. The webapp and database 
keep a record of checkins, keeping a login, lat and lng. A vulnerability or hack 
is considered anything that can be exploited/deceived within the system.</p>

<p>Testing was done without looking at the source code, then more vulnerabilities
were found through examining the source code. Curl was used for a majority of the attacks.</p>

<h4>Vulnerabilities</h4>

<p>1. No Data Verification</p>
<p>
The first most glaring vulnerability found is that there is no data verification in 
the /sendlocation path. The user can easily lie about login, lattitude and 
longitude. Below is a screenshot of fake data entered into the system.</p>

<p>The latitude and longitude are faked, and the login is made up as well. Reccomendations
for this include using the browser's geoip property if avilable, and if not a geoip
lookup function. Additionally login could be checked against a valid list of logins.</p>


<p>2. X-Site Scripting</p>
<p>Another vulnerability found is the potential for cross-site scripting of javascript. This
was done by inserting javascript code into the login parameter, which was then run when the
webapp displayed that login info. A screenshot below of a cross-site scripted alert:</p>

<p>Recommendation to sanitize the login further than simply ensure that it is not undefined. </p>


<p>3. Database Overloading</p>
<p>eBcause of the POST Xml HTTP Request being used to fill the database with entries, this
can be easily automated through shell script or on another webapp. This can fill up the
mongoDB database with unusable information until there is no room for usable data, or the 
database crashes. A screenshot of a partially filled database (through shell scripting)
 is shown:</p>

<p>Recommendation for this would be to include a timer variable for each domain, which would
limit how oftena  domain could send a request. </p>



<p>4. Database Intrusion </p>
<p>The GET command allows one to view all documents within a database that have a certain login. 
One can view simply all documents by entering a certain url command. Screenshot of url and 
returned all items in database:</p>


<p>I would recommend sanitizing the login command for the app.get function. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The above issues represent major security flaws in Tom's webapp. These flaws will inevitably 
prove too dangerous for future use unless some of the above recommendations are implemented
or other ways to patch up security holes. </p>

<p>Patching up security issues like this woul take some considerable time, and a typical price
I would charge for such a service would be approximately $600. The best way to do this would 
be to make sure to sanitize the database queries, verify and sanitize all input, and limit
database queries on a time-basis. </p>
