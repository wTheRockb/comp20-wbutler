readme for jquery lab
Woody Butler 10/28/2014

The purpose of the lab was to familiarize ourselves with jquery as an alternate
to javascript, and to show its expanded capabilities/ease of use for more 
complex tasks.

The html page correctly shows all past newsfeeds from past using local storage.
Additionally it also dispalys those feeds on top, with a timestamp.
