The purpose of the lab was to use the html5 geolocation api to locate the user, and report that coordinate's to Ming's Heroku app along with a username. This would return a JSON text that could be parsed to reveal the login, location and timestamp of other students and characters. The students were tobe displayed on the gogle maps API through markers and the characters were to have their own icons. Lines drawing betwen the user's marker and the caharacters were to be drawn and the distance reported. Info windows also were to be shown when any marker clicked including relevant info.
